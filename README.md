# Bill's Passage
## Description
Bill’s Passage is a lightweight choice-driven resource management game intended to serve as an educational resource about the process by which bills are passed into law in the United States Federal Government. This game was developed by Benny Mattis in response to the Library of Congress Friends’ Choice Civics Video Game Challenge of 2023. It was inspired by a game enthusiast who wished to remain anonymous.

Players play as Bill, who aims to join his predecessors in the halls of history by being passed into law. One of these predecessors offers Bill guidance as he garners the support of elected representatives in the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the White House.

On each play-through, the President and members of Congress are randomly generated with some of the most popular surnames in the United States.

Bill has two years (104 weeks) to get passed in the House of Representatives, in the Senate, and at the President’s desk. On each turn, Bill must decide whether to spend the week garnering support, finding representatives, or being put to a vote. 

The support of individual representatives increases the probability that they will vote for Bill and   increases the probability that they will build support for Bill among their colleagues.

Public support takes longer to get, but it has some influence on the opinions of all representatives at the time of the decisive vote.

Industry support is a kind of “power-up” that will increase the impact of moves to garner the other two types of support.

Bill will get diminishing returns if he garners a single type of support for multiple weeks in a row.
